PyL - Lisp in Python
====================

My first experience in LISP has been via Scheme. The forest of parens aside,
I find that thinking in LISP comes very naturally and actually is a great way
to build projects in the large by leveraging the clarity that functional
programming brings to the table.

This is my attempt to try to build a LISP interpreter in Python. Largely
inspired by the thought and code from Peter Norvig's implementation of
Lisp in Python via lispy, I am 'only' exploring to see if there is
anything interesting that can be built here.

Building simple rule based engines are great to do in the lisp style of
programming what with the system being largely functional and completely
stateless - I am hoping to see some light at the end of tunnel.

Going forward I plan to play around with ast module of Python and see
how it can be included in PyL.

Roadmaps
--------
1. Building a good set of pure functional operators
2. Ability to call a Python class from PyL in functional style
3. Ability to work using Python's ast
